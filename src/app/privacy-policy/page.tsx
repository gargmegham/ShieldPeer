This notice applies across all websites that we own and operate and all services we provide, including our online and mobile software services products, and any other apps or services we may offer (our “services”)

When we say “personal data”, we mean information that would identify you, like your name, email, address, telephone number, bank account details, payment information and so on. The same would apply to information that could identify other users in your teams that are shared with ShieldPeer.

If you can't be identified (for example, when personal data has been aggregated and anonymised), the information wouldn't be personal data anymore, and this notice doesn't apply.

We may need to update this notice from time to time. When a significant change is made, we'll make sure we let you know – usually by sending you an email.

Clause 1: Who are “we”?
When we refer to “we” (or “our” or “us'), that means ShieldPeer and all its wholly owned subsidiaries, including the primary operating entity, ShieldPeer Our headquarters is located in Jagadhri. Address details for all ShieldPeer offices are available on our “Contact Us” page.

Clause 2: Our Principles of Data Protection
Our approach to data protection is built around three key principles:
1. Transparency: We are open, honest and transparent, and you could always contact us if you have any queries.
2. Enablement: We have efficient use of personal data to enhance productivity and growth and to have you make connections between the information you have and the insights you want.
3. Security: We adopt industry leading approaches to secure the personal data entrusted to us.

Clause 3: How we collect your data
When you visit our websites or use our services, we collect personal data. The ways we collect it can be broadly categorised into the following:
1. Information you submit in order to use our product: When you use our product, we might ask you to provide personal data to us.
2. Information you provide to us directly: When you visit or use some parts of our websites and/or services, we might ask you to provide personal data to us.
3. Information we collect automatically: We collect some information about you automatically when you visit our websites or use our product/services, like your IP address and device type. We also collect information when you navigate through our websites and services, including what pages you looked at and what links you clicked on. This information is useful for us as it helps us get a better understanding of how you're using our websites and services so that we can continue to provide the best experience possible (e.g., by personalising the content you see). Some of this information is collected using cookies and similar tracking technologies.
4. Information we get from third parties: The majority of information we collect, we collect directly from you. We don't collect personal data about you from other sources.
Where we collect personal data, we'll only process it:
-   to perform a contract with you; or
-   where we have legitimate interests to process the personal data and they're not overridden by your rights; or
-   in accordance with a legal obligation; or
-   where we have your consent.
If we don't collect your personal data, we may be unable to provide you with all our services, and some functions and features on our websites may not be available to you.
If you're someone who doesn't have a relationship with us, but believe that a ShieldPeer subscriber has entered your personal data into our websites or services, you'll need to contact that ShieldPeer subscriber for any questions you have about your personal data (including where you want to access, correct, amend, or request that the user delete, your personal data).

Clause 4: How we use your data
First and foremost, we use your personal data to operate our websites and provide you with any services you've requested, and to manage our relationship with you. We don't use your personal data for any other purposes. We only use your personal data for the following purposes:
1. To communicate with you. This may include:
    - providing you with information you've requested from us (like training or education materials) or information we are required to send to you;
    - operational communications, like changes to our websites and services, security updates, or assistance with using our websites and services;
    - marketing communications (about ShieldPeer or another product or service we think you might be interested in) in accordance with your marketing preferences;
    - asking you for feedback or to take part in any research we are conducting (which we may engage a third party to assist with).
2. To help you share information with those whom you want to share information with and to assist you in making statutory submissions.
3. To support you: This may include assisting with the resolution of technical support issues or other issues relating to the websites or services, whether by email, in-app support or otherwise.

1. When we share data, it may be transferred to, and processed in, countries other than the country you live in. These countries may have laws which are different from what you're used to. Rest assured, where we disclose personal data to a third party in another country, we put safeguards in place to ensure your personal data remains protected.
2. For individuals in the European Economic Area (EEA), this means that your data may be transferred outside of the EEA. Where your personal data is transferred outside the EEA, it will only be transferred to countries that have been identified as providing adequate protection for EEA data (like New Zealand), or to a third party where we have approved transfer mechanisms in place to protect your personal data – i.e., by entering into the European Commission's Standard Contractual Clauses, or by ensuring the entity is Privacy Shield certified (for transfers to US-based third parties).

Clause 7: Security
Security is a priority for us when it comes to your personal data. We're committed to protecting your personal data and have appropriate technical and organisational measures in place to make sure that happens.

Clause 8: Retention
1. The length of time we keep your personal data depends on what it is and whether we have an ongoing business need to retain it (for example, to provide you with a service you've requested or to comply with applicable legal, tax or accounting requirements).
2. We'll retain your personal data for as long as we have a relationship with you and for a period of time afterwards where we have an ongoing business need to retain it, in accordance with our data retention policies and practices. Following that period, we'll make sure it's deleted or anonymised.
